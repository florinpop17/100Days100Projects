## Purpose

100 Days - 100 Projects it's a challenge that's meant to help you improve your coding skills by creating projects (lots of them :smiley:).

There are also three other variants you might want to try
- **#7Days7Projects** - the easy one
- **#30Days30Projects** - the middle one
- **#365Days365Projects** - the Ultimate Challenge
 so i am also trying to say that we can do more projects.but the problem is we are not able to face the situation.we are giving up the sutuation.so we shouldn't do that.
 
 so for starting the projects we have mainly like of ml,AI, and IoT.so from that we can start tthe project. and we have to start the new project to learn about that.
 
  
You can find the detailed information about the Challenge [on my blog](https://florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects).

In this repository you'll be able to propose new projects by creating an issue for each of them.

Have fun! :innocent:
