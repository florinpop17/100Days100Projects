## Purpose

100 Days - 100 Projects it's a challenge that's meant to help you improve your coding skills by creating projects (lots of them :smiley:).

There are also three other variants you might want to try
- **#7Days7Projects** - the easy one
- **#30Days30Projects** - the middle one
- **#365Days365Projects** - the Ultimate Challenge
 we can do more projects in this of IoT, ml AI,of like helping blind people or to make software to improve the alexa with edit and make  by matic.
 
 
  so we have many ideas to make the projects but we are not ready to accept the situation . so when we learn the techniques of that we are all high on this.
  
  
You can find the detailed information about the Challenge [on my blog](https://florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects).

In this repository you'll be able to propose new projects by creating an issue for each of them.

Have fun! :innocent:
